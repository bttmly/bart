# bart

A small Node wrapper around the [BART XML API](http://api.bart.gov/docs/overview/index.aspx).

## Why isn't this on `npm`?

Because the shape of responses is going to change. Specifically, nested responses are going to be flattened for a more ergonomic API. This will be resolved soon and published to `npm` at that point.
